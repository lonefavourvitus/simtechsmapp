				Why CDR?<br />
				It all began with a simple yet profound idea: a question surfaced â€“ how can we design a point-of-sale
				(POS)/sales management system that minimizes hardware dependency for pharmacies, supermarkets,
				and retail companies? Our aim was clear: to empower these markets with heightened efficiency
				and cost-effectiveness.
			</p>
			<p in:fly={{ y: 50, duration: 500 }}>
				Traditionally, sales management systems for pharmacies/supermarkets/retail companies heavily
				lean on point-of-sale (POS) systems, burdened by hardware necessities such as inventory
				scanners, barcode readers, router/network equipment, and moreâ€”all of which contribute to
				associated costs. Our driving force is to strategically shift the load of these
				hardware-dependent operations, as much as possible, to the software side. We're committed to
				embracing a digital approach that trims down hardware dependencies significantly, thus
				resulting in substantial cost reductions.
			</p>
			<p in:fly={{ y: 50, duration: 500 }}>
				With CDR Software, we're pioneering a transition that liberates
				pharmacies/supermarkets/retail companies from bulky hardware setups. By doing so, we
				streamline operations, enhance flexibility, and boost cost-effectiveness. Imagine a pharmacy
				experience where technology seamlessly integrates into your workflow, making every
				transaction smoother and every process more efficient.
			</p>
			<p in:fly={{ y: 50, duration: 500 }}>
				Our mission is to empower pharmacies/supermarkets/retail companies, allowing them to
				dedicate more time to what truly mattersâ€”caring for their customers and community. CDR
				Software is the bridge between vision and reality, embodying a future where pharmacy
				management is intuitive, adaptable, and accessible to all.
			</p>
			<p in:fly={{ y: 50, duration: 500 }}>
				SO IN THE END, WHO REALLY NEEDS THIS SOFTWARE?<br />
				In essence, our software offers a dual advantage. On a practical level, if you're seeking to
				steer clear of bulky, power-hungry hardware that eats up space, this software provides an elegant
				solution. Delving deeper, it represents an opportunity for major sales companies to explore our
				software, making a smooth transition to a fully digital, hardware-light environment. It's the
				promise of efficiency and a leap into a more streamlined future.
